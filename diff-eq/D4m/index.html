    <p>
      A <span class="m">\(4\)</span> kg mass is attached to a spring with
      constant <span class="m">\(16\)</span> N/m. The mass is pulled outward
      <span class="m">\(7\)</span> meters and released from rest.
      Then after <span class="m">\(5\)</span> seconds, the mass is struck
      by a hammer, imparting <span class="m">\(8\)</span> Newtons of inward
      impulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Give an IVP that models this scenario,
      then solve it. Use your solution to find the
      position of the mass when <span class="m">\(t=9\)</span>.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="answer"><h4>Answer.</h4>
    <p>An IVP modeling this scenario is given by:</p>
    <p class="me">\[4 \, {x''} + 16 \, {x} = -8 \, \delta\left({t} - 5\right)\hspace{2em}x(0)=7,x'(0)=0\]</p>
    <p>This IVP solves to:</p>
    <p class="me">\[{x} = -\sin\left(2 \, {t} - 10\right) u\left({t} - 5\right) + 7 \, \cos\left(2 \, {t}\right)\]</p>
    <p>
      It follows that when <span class="m">\(t=9\)</span>,
      the position of the mass is <span class="m">\(3.633\)</span>
      meters.
