      the inner spring has constant <span class="m">\(15\)</span> N/m,

      natural position, while the outer mass is moved
      <span class="m">\(\frac{45}{2}\)</span> meters inwards from its natural position. Both
      masses are then simultaneously released from rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Give a system of IVPs that models this scenario,
      then solve the system. Use your solution to find the
      position of both masses after <span class="m">\(4\)</span> seconds.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="answer"><h4>Answer.</h4>
    <p>The IVP system is given by:</p>
    <p class="me">\[2 x_1''=- 22 x_1+ 4 x_2\hspace{2em}x_1(0)= 0 ,x_1'(0)=0\]</p>
    <p class="me">\[1 x_2''= 4 x_1- 4 x_2\hspace{2em}x_2(0)= -\frac{45}{2} ,x_2'(0)=0\]</p>
    <p>This system solves to:</p>
    <p class="me">\[x_1= 5 \, \cos\left(2 \, \sqrt{3} t\right) - 5 \, \cos\left(\sqrt{3} t\right)\]</p>
    <p class="me">\[x_2= -\frac{5}{2} \, \cos\left(2 \, \sqrt{3} t\right) - 20 \, \cos\left(\sqrt{3} t\right)\]</p>
    <p>
      Thus after <span class="m">\(4\)</span> seconds, the inner mass is located approximately
      <span class="m">\(-2.61\)</span> meters from its natural position, and the outer
      mass is located approximately <span class="m">\(-16.7\)</span> meters from its natural position.
    </p>
