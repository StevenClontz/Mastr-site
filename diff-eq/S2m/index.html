      the inner spring has constant <span class="m">\(15\)</span> N/m,

      natural position, while the outer mass is moved

  <div class="answer"><h4>Answer.</h4>
    <p>The IVP system is given by:</p>
    <p class="me">\[1 x_1''=- 10 x_1+ 6 x_2\hspace{2em}x_1(0)= 2 ,x_1'(0)=0\]</p>
    <p class="me">\[2 x_2''= 6 x_1- 6 x_2\hspace{2em}x_2(0)= -\frac{13}{3} ,x_2'(0)=0\]</p>
    <p>This system solves to:</p>
    <p class="me">\[x_1= 4 \, \cos\left(2 \, \sqrt{3} t\right) - 2 \, \cos\left(t\right)\]</p>
    <p class="me">\[x_2= -\frac{4}{3} \, \cos\left(2 \, \sqrt{3} t\right) - 3 \, \cos\left(t\right)\]</p>
    <p>
      Thus after <span class="m">\(5\)</span> seconds, the inner mass is located approximately
      <span class="m">\(-0.401\)</span> meters from its natural position, and the outer
      mass is located approximately <span class="m">\(-0.906\)</span> meters from its natural position.

  <h2 class="title">S2m: Coupled mass-spring systems (ver. 99)</h2>
  <div class="statement">
    <p>
      Consider a coupled mass-spring system where 
      the inner mass is <span class="m">\(2\)</span> kg, 
      the outer mass is <span class="m">\(1\)</span> kg,
      the inner spring has constant <span class="m">\(4\)</span> N/m,
      the outer spring has constant <span class="m">\(2\)</span> N/m.
      The inner mass is moved <span class="m">\(6\)</span> meters inwards from its
      natural position, while the outer mass is moved
      <span class="m">\(3\)</span> meters inwards from its natural position. Both
      masses are then simultaneously released from rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Give a system of IVPs that models this scenario,
      then solve the system. Use your solution to find the
      position of both masses after <span class="m">\(2\)</span> seconds.

  <div class="answer"><h4>Answer.</h4>
    <p>The IVP system is given by:</p>

    <p class="me">\[1 x_2''= 2 x_1- 2 x_2\hspace{2em}x_2(0)= -3 ,x_2'(0)=0\]</p>
    <p>This system solves to:</p>
    <p class="me">\[x_1= -3 \, \cos\left(2 \, t\right) - 3 \, \cos\left(t\right)\]</p>
    <p class="me">\[x_2= 3 \, \cos\left(2 \, t\right) - 6 \, \cos\left(t\right)\]</p>
    <p>
      Thus after <span class="m">\(2\)</span> seconds, the inner mass is located approximately
      <span class="m">\(3.21\)</span> meters from its natural position, and the outer

  <div class="answer"><h4>Answer.</h4>
    <p>The IVP system is given by:</p>
