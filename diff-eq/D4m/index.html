    <p>An IVP modeling this scenario is given by:</p>
    <p class="me">\[2 \, {x''} + 8 \, {x} = -4 \, \delta\left({t} - 7\right)\hspace{2em}x(0)=5,x'(0)=0\]</p>
    <p>This IVP solves to:</p>
    <p class="me">\[{x} = -\sin\left(2 \, {t} - 14\right) u\left({t} - 7\right) + 5 \, \cos\left(2 \, {t}\right)\]</p>
    <p>
      It follows that when <span class="m">\(t=8\)</span>,
      the position of the mass is <span class="m">\(-5.698\)</span>
      meters.

    <p>
      A <span class="m">\(2\)</span> kg mass is attached to a spring with
